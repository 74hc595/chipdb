# ChipDB

## Open source integrated circuit quick reference database

This repository is a collection of part definitions from [msarnoff.org/chipdb](http://msarnoff.org/chipdb) a.k.a. [chipdb.net](chipdb.net), a quick reference for integrated circuit pinouts and other data.

I started ChipDB in 2009, and since then the data has always been stored privately on my server. The first entries were transcribed by myself. I set up a rudimentary editor and hacked-together submission system, and several others contributed parts, but it never really got off the ground.

At the suggestion of [Eon Jeong](http://twitter.com/wonderjune), I've taken all the data and put it on GitHub, for others to use and contribute to. Pull requests are welcome: see CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.

The data set includes pinouts for the most common 7400 series, 4000 series, and linear chips, as well as many Atmel microcontrollers and several PICs in [YAML](http://yaml.org) format.
